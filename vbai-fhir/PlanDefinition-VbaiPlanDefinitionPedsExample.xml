Well, I sure do. To amuse myself, I went twice last spring. My most MEMORABLE moment was riding on the Caterpillar, which is a gigantic roller coaster high above the ground. When I saw how high the Caterpillar rose into the bright blue sky I knew it was for me. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, “There’s no turning back now.” People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar. Taking a trip to the amusement park and riding on the Caterpillar was my MOST memorable moment ever!”

    “What is your favorite animal?” 

    “what does it sound like?”

    “I like your toy! Does your toy have a name?” 

    “what does your toy say?”

    If preferred toy not present, bring out animal toys (barn setup):  

    Parent and child sit down together 

    Child picks up animal toys 

    Parent makes animal sounds with each toy the child picks up 

Parent may also want to move animals around the barn scene if child not engaging with the toys and make noises with each animal they hold 

    Hopefully, this inspires child to vocalize, too
