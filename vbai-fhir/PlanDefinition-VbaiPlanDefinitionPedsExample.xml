-  You wished to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old. He dresses himself in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons; yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever. A long, flowing beard clings to his chin, giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect. When he speaks his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle. Twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon our small organ. Except in the winter when the ooze or snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day. We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, “Banana Oil!” Grandfather likes to be modern in his language. </td><td> </td><td>routine</td></tr></table></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 1.4</p><p><b>title</b>: PMHX and List of Confounders</p><p><b>description</b>: Gather PMHx and Cofounders that need to be collected</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p><p><b>definition</b>: <a href="Questionnaire-VbaiQuestionnaireCofoundersExample2.html">Cofounder Surveys</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 1.5</p><p><b>title</b>: Questionnaires</p><p><b>description</b>: Administer validated questionnaires</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p><h3>Actions</h3><table class="grid"><tr><td>-</td><td><b>Prefix</b></td><td><b>Title</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><td><b>Priority</b></td><td><b>Definition[x]</b></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>1.5.1</td><td>PHQ9 Questionniare</td><td>Administer PHQ9 Questionnaire</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="Questionnaire-PHQ9schema.html">PHQ9_schema</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>1.5.2</td><td>GAD7 Questionniare</td><td>Administer GAD7 Questionnaire</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="Questionnaire-GAD7schema.html">GAD7_schema</a></td></tr></table></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 1.6</p><p><b>title</b>: Feedback Pilot</p><p><b>description</b>: Questions for feedback for pilot​</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: B</p><p><b>title</b>: Part B Peds</p><p><b>description</b>: Tasks specific to Peds cohort ​</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p><h3>Actions</h3><table class="grid"><tr><td>-</td><td><b>Prefix</b></td><td><b>Title</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>B.1 Task 1</td><td>Produce sustained /a/ sound </td><td>

      <description value="Do you like amusement parks? Well, I sure do. To amuse myself, I went twice last spring. My most MEMORABLE moment was riding on the Caterpillar, which is a gigantic roller coaster high above the ground. When I saw how high the Caterpillar rose into the bright blue sky I knew it was for me. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, “There’s no turning back now.” People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar. Taking a trip to the amusement park and riding on the Caterpillar was my MOST memorable moment ever!” &#xA;    Modification: recite passage sentence by sentence after adult"/>
