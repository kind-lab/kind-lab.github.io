Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, “There’s no turning back now.” People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar.

-  You wished to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old. He dresses himself in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons; yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever. A long, flowing beard clings to his chin, giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect. When he speaks his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle. Twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon our small organ. Except in the winter when the ooze or snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day. We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, “Banana Oil!” Grandfather likes to be modern in his language. </td><td> </td><td>routine</td></tr></table></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 1.6</p><p><b>title</b>: PMHX and List of Confounders</p><p><b>description</b>: Gather PMHx and Confounders that need to be collected</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p><p><b>definition</b>: <a href="Questionnaire-VbaiQuestionnaireConfoundersExample.html">Confounder Surveys</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 1.7</p><p><b>title</b>: Questionnaires</p><p><b>description</b>: Administer validated questionnaires</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p><h3>Actions</h3><table class="grid"><tr><td>-</td><td><b>Prefix</b></td><td><b>Title</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><td><b>Priority</b></td><td><b>Definition[x]</b></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>1.7.1</td><td>PHQ9 Questionniare</td><td>Administer PHQ9 Questionnaire</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="Questionnaire-PHQ9schema.html">PHQ9_schema</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>1.7.2</td><td>GAD7 Questionniare</td><td>Administer GAD7 Questionnaire</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="Questionnaire-GAD7schema.html">GAD7_schema</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>1.7.3</td><td>Voice Perception Questionniare</td><td>Administer Voice Perception Questionnaire</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="Questionnaire-VoicePerception.html">Voice Perception</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>1.7.4</td><td>VHI-10 Questionniare</td><td>Administer VHI-10 Questionnaire</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="Questionnaire-VHI10.html">VHI-10</a></td></tr></table></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 1.8</p><p><b>title</b>: Feedback Pilot</p><p><b>description</b>: Questions for feedback for pilot​</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>action</b></p><p><b>prefix</b>: 2.x</p><p><b>title</b>: Cohort Specific PlanDefinitions</p><p><b>description</b>: PlanDefinitions specifics based on cohort</p><p><b>priority</b>: routine</p><h3>Actions</h3><table class="grid"><tr><td>-</td><td><b>Prefix</b></td><td><b>Title</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><td><b>Priority</b></td><td><b>Definition[x]</b></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>2.1</td><td>Mood Cohort</td><td>PlanDefinition Mood Cohort</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="PlanDefinition-VbaiPlanDefinitionMoodExample.html">Mood Cohort Protocol</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>2.2</td><td>Voice Cohort</td><td>PlanDefinition Voice Cohort</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="PlanDefinition-VbaiPlanDefinitionVoiceExample.html">Voice Cohort Protocol</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>2.3</td><td>Peds Cohort</td><td>PlanDefinition Peds Cohort</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="PlanDefinition-VbaiPlanDefinitionPedsExample.html">Pediatrics Cohort Protocol</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>2.4</td><td>Neurology Cohort</td><td>PlanDefinition Neurology Cohort</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="PlanDefinition-VbaiPlanDefinitionNeurologyExample.html">Neurology Cohort Protocol</a></td></tr><tr><td>*</td><td>2.5</td><td>Respiratory Cohort</td><td>PlanDefinition Respiratory  Cohort</td><td>routine</td><td><a href="PlanDefinition-VbaiPlanDefinitionRespiratoryExample.html">Respiratory Cohort Protocol</a></td></tr></table></blockquote></div>

We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, “Banana Oil!” Grandfather likes to be modern in his language. "/>
