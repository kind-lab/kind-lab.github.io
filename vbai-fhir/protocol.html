<h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>

<p>This document describes the protocol used in data collection for the Voice as a Biomarker of Health project, a large multi-institutional study funded by the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Bridge2AI program.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-study">About this study</h2>

<p>Voice as a Biomarker of Health is a study from the Bridge2AI-Voice Consortium with the
mission to create a large-ethically sourced and diverse voice database linked to other
health information to diagnose diseases.
We collect voice and health data from many patients with different many different
diseases from 5 broad categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Voice Disorders</strong>, including laryngeal Cancer, vocal fold paralysis, spasmodic dysphonia, recurrent laryngeal papilloma (RRP), benign vocal cord lesion</li>
  <li><strong>Neurological and Neurodegenerative Disorders</strong>, such as Dementia, Alzheimer’s, Stroke, ALS, Ataxia, Parkinsons</li>
  <li><strong>Respiratory Disorders</strong>, including Asthma, Pneumonia, COPD, Chronic Cough, Heart failure, OSA, Airway Stenosis</li>
  <li><strong>Mood Disorders</strong>, including Depression, Bipolar disorder, Anxiety disorder, Schizophrenia</li>
  <li><strong>Pediatrics Disorders</strong>, such as Autism, Speech Delay</li>
</ul>

<p>The data collected in this study will be used to create algorithms to diagnose diseases
based on voice recordings. The data will be made available to researchers and
developers to create applications to improve the health of patients.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-protocol">About this protocol</h2>

<p>This protocol is used to collect data from patients in the Voice as a Biomarker of Health
study. The protocol is designed to be portable, allowing sharing of the collected data
across a diverse set of stakeholders.</p>

<p>At its core, the protocol constitutes a number of Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources (FHIR) which strictly define acceptable inputs. The design of these FHIR resources
was collaboratively decided by the Bridge2AI-Voice Consortium.</p>

  <strong>Note:</strong> If you don't know what the PlanDefinition, Questionnaire, and QuestionnaireResponse resources are, head over to the <a href="/vbai-fhir/brief_fhir_intro.html">brief FHIR intro</a> page.
</div>

<p>Data collection was standardized into a set of sequential phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eligibility</li>
  <li>Consent</li>
  <li>Demographic Questionnaire</li>
  <li>Acoustic Tasks</li>
  <li>Cohort Specific Tasks</li>
  <li>Confounder Questionnaire</li>
  <li>Validated Questionnaires</li>
  <li>Clinician Input</li>
  <li>Feedback</li>
</ol>

<p>The first 3 phases are collected once for each individual upon enrollment into the study.
The subsequent phases are collected for each data collection session.
The following sections describe each of these phases in detail.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Audio check (Audio check: Before we start, let’s test your microphone. Click on the Start button below and say something out loud like “Testing 1, 2, 3”. Recording will stop automatically after 5 seconds. Click Play to hear your recording. If you hear background noise, please go to a quieter place and try again by selecting Redo Recording. If it sounds good, continue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>​Count to 3 and say “e” for 5 seconds&nbsp;(This task helps us analyze features in your voice)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maximum phonation time: Say /e/ (max. phonation time ): ‘Using your normal voice, take a deep breath and say /e/’ until you run completely out of air (click stop when you run out of air)’. (need to ask for this task twice!)&nbsp;</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rainbow passage : ‘Read the following passage using your normal voice:’ Short Rainbow passage: ‘￼Read the following passage using your normal voice: When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cape-V Sentences: “Read these sentences using your normal voice”  The blue spot is on the key again, How hard did he hit him?, We were away a year ago, We eat eggs every easter, My momma makes lemon muffins, Peter will keep at the peak  This is a standardized passage that contains all the important sounds of the English language</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caterpillar passage ‘Read the following passage using your normal voice:’ Caterpillar passage: Do you like amusement parks? Well, I sure do. To amuse myself, I went twice last spring. My most MEMORABLE moment was riding on the Caterpillar, which is a gigantic rollercoaster high above the ground. When I saw how high the Caterpillar rose into the bright blue sky I knew it was for me. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, “There’s no turning back now.” People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar. Taking a trip to the amusement park and riding on the Caterpillar was my MOST memorable moment ever!&nbsp;</p>

When you are ready, you will be asked to recall the story. This can be in your own words.”  -  You wished to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old. He dresses himself in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons; yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever. A long, flowing beard clings to his chin, giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect. When he speaks his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle. Twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon our small organ. Except in the winter when the ooze or snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day. We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, “Banana Oil!” Grandfather likes to be modern in his language.&nbsp;</li>

To amuse myself, I went twice last spring. b. My most MEMORABLE moment was riding on the Caterpillar, which is a gigantic roller coaster high above the ground. When I saw how high the Caterpillar rose into the bright blue sky, I knew it was for me. c. After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. d. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, “There’s no turning back now.” e. People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. f. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. g. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar. h. Taking a trip to the amusement park and riding on the Caterpillar was my MOST memorable moment ever!</li>
