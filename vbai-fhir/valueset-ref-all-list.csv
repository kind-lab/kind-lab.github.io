If no source is indicated in the definition comments, then these are example FHIR codes.          It can be extended with appropriate roles described by SNOMED as well as those described in the HL7 Role Based Access Control Catalog and the          HL7 Healthcare (Security and Privacy) Access Control Catalog.            In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), permissions are operations on an object that a user wishes to access. Permissions are grouped into roles.          A role characterizes the functions a user is allowed to perform. Roles are assigned to users. If the user's role has the appropriate permissions          to access an object, then that user is granted access to the object. FHIR readily enables RBAC, as FHIR Resources are object types and the CRUDE          events (the FHIR equivalent to permissions in the RBAC scheme) are operations on those objects.          In Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), a user requests to perform operations on objects. That user's access request is granted or denied          based on a set of access control policies that are specified in terms of attributes and conditions. FHIR readily enables ABAC, as instances of          a Resource in FHIR (again, Resources are object types) can have attributes associated with them. These attributes include security tags,          environment conditions, and a host of user and object characteristics, which are the same attributes as those used in ABAC. Attributes help          define the access control policies that determine the operations a user may perform on a Resource (in FHIR) or object (in ABAC). For example,          a tag (or attribute) may specify that the identified Resource (object) is not to be further disclosed without explicit consent from the patient.","StructureDefinition/vbai-consent","THO (V3),THO,DICOM"
