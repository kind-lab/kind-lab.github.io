After waiting in line for thirty minutes, I made it to the front where the man measured my height to see if I was tall enough. I gave the man my coins, asked for change, and jumped on the cart. Tick, tick, tick, the Caterpillar climbed slowly up the tracks. It went SO high I could see the parking lot. Boy was I SCARED! I thought to myself, “There’s no turning back now.” People were so scared they screamed as we swiftly zoomed fast, fast, and faster along the tracks. As quickly as it started, the Caterpillar came to a stop. Unfortunately, it was time to pack the car and drive home. That night I dreamt of the wild ride on the Caterpillar.

Please read the information about the study presented in this form. The form includes details on study’s risks and benefits that you should know before you decide if you would like to take part. You should take as much time as you need to make your decision. You should ask the study doctor or study staff to explain anything that you do not understand and make sure that all of your questions have been answered before signing this consent form.  Before you make your decision, feel free to talk about this study with anyone you wish including your friends, family, and family doctor.  \n\nTaking part in this study is voluntary. You have the option to not participate at all or you may choose to leave the study at any time. Whatever you choose, it will not affect the usual medical care that you receive outside the study. \n\nThe sections in this Introduction provide the basic information about the study. More detailed information is provided in the remainder of the document. This study is conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), University of Toronto (UofT), University of South Florida (USF), Weil Cornell Medicine (WCM), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), , Hospitals for Sick Children (HSC), Simon Fraser University (SFU), Hasting Center, Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and Washington University (WashU) and is supported/sponsored by The National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nEach individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features that have been linked to various health conditions, including mood disorders, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and some cancers. Recent advances in voice analysis technology, in particular those linked to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), have shed new insights into the detection of diseases by studying changes in voice and speech. As a biomarker, voice is unique, cost-effective, easy, and safe to collect in low resource settings.  Moreover, the human voice not only contains speech, but also other biomarkers such as respiratory sounds, and cough. The Bridge2AI-Voice as a Biomarker of Health, funded by NIH, aims to integrate voice as a biomarker of health into clinical care by creating a substantial multi-institutional voice database. This resource will fuel voice AI research, predictive modeling, disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The primary goal of the study is to build an ethically sourced, diverse database of human voices, speech, and respiratory sounds linked to health biomarkers using a secure mobile/tablet application and IT infrastructure with federated learning for data privacy. Multi-institutional collaborations between voice experts, AI engineers, bioethicists, and social scientists promote ethical data sourcing. The app will integrate voice data with imaging, demographics, and genomics and federated learning will enable collaborative research without sharing raw or private data. The Bridge2AI-Voice Consortium focuses on voice changes associated with five disease categories (respiratory disorders, voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders, and pediatric voice and speech disorders) in patients at USF specialty clinics and participating institutions. This research study being conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and University of Toronto (UofT), will focus specifically on Neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Collaborations with High Volume Expert Clinics and Community Clinics ensure database diversity. The four-year project spans 11 academic sites in the US and Canada, with potential expansions. De-identified voice and clinical data will be accessible on a cloud-based infrastructure for future Voice AI research.\n\nThe secondary goal of this study is to find potential genetic links between changes in voice, speech and language among individuals affected by cognitive impairment and the development and advancement of Alzheimer’s disease. For this purpose, whole genome sequencing or genotyping of specific genes will be performed to find out if there are any genetic variations that are responsible for your disease. Your genome data will then be used to create a genomic database and your genomic data will be stored in a controlled-access genomic databank (such as dbGaP) to link it to your voice data. Whole genome sequencing and genotyping are advanced techniques used to analyze your genetic information. Whole genome sequencing involves reading and interpreting all the genes present in your entire DNA. This helps researchers understand your genetic makeup, which can provide valuable insights into potential health risks. On the other hand, genotyping focuses on specific genes or DNA variants of interest. It allows us to pinpoint particular genetic variations that may be relevant to your disease. Both methods involve collecting a small sample of your DNA, typically through a blood sample. \n\nAdditionally, we would like to inform you that if, in the future, we develop a safe and effective method for returning the results of your genome test, we may reach out to you. This is to ensure that you have the opportunity to learn about any significant findings that could be relevant to your health or well-being. Please be assured that any communication regarding the delivery of these results will be conducted with utmost care and respect for your privacy. We value your participation and understand the importance of keeping you informed about the potential implications of the genetic information obtained through whole genome sequencing or genotyping.  \n\nThe overall goal of this project is to find speech biomarkers for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease by collaborating with experts in data science, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze information, and to link it to multimodal health biomarkers (such as imaging, demographics and genomics). This research could lead to better screening, detection, prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n' (INVALID)

If the patient is too ill to consent on their own, a substitute decision maker such as next of kin, spouse or partner, relative under the patient’s care can consent. If the patient regains the ability to consent, the medical team will inform the study coordinator and the patient will be reconsented remotely for the study. The last page on the consent form about reconsenting will need to be filled out by the study coordinator.\n\nIf you choose email, you will be informed that the communication via email is not a secure form of communication. If you agree, then the study coordinator will obtain and confirm your email ID. If you choose the mail option, a return labeled enveloped will be sent with the consent form. The call for verbal consenting and review will be scheduled within a week of the initial call. If for any reason you have lost your copy of the consent form prior to speaking with the study coordinator, a new copy will be sent to you via email or mail. If you choose verbal consent then the study coordinator will obtain informed consent over the phone.\n\nAt the verbal consent session via telephone, the study coordinator will verbally review the information contained in the consent form and give you the opportunity to seek clarification on any points, if needed. Only after you demonstrate that you understand each section of the consent, you will be considered to have given consent. Not all aspects of the consent are mandatory; therefore, for each part of the consent you will verbally acknowledge your decision. If after reviewing the consent you would still like to take part in the study, the study coordinator will ask you to verbalize your consent by answering “yes” to the question “Is this all agreeable to you?” If you agree, you can sign and send back a copy of the signed consent by email, again with the understanding that email is not a secure form of communication or via mail. Once received, the study coordinator should sign their section (person obtaining consent) and send back a fully signed copy to you. \n\nIf you are not comfortable with consent being sent through email for obtaining signature, the option of sending the consent by mail will be offered. If that is not acceptable either, then verbal consent can also be obtained, provided the consent is documented and witnessed (through setting up a 3-way videoconferencing or phone call). You will be asked to retain a copy of the consent form for your record.\u00a0 The study coordinator will sign the verbal consent script which will be kept in a separate secure location from the other study materials in the study offices at Mount Sinai Hospital. Consents will be kept in a locked file in the study office of Mount Sinai Hospital and will be destroyed after 25 years after study completion.\n\nIf the e-consent session is conducted via the smartphone/tablet application, then the study coordinator will guide you through the enrollment process where you will be introduced to the study, and will be asked questions regarding your diagnosis, other questions to determine if you fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria via the application. Then, the application will let you know if you are eligible to participate in the study followed by the consenting process. The informed consent form will be shown to you directly via the application and once reviewed, you will be able to click a button in the application to consent to the study or click a button to decline to not participate in the study.

However, this would also mean that you withdraw from the study. \n\nDe-identified data or coded data that cannot be linked back to you and is shared with other researchers in any open access or controlled access databank in the future, may not deleted once it is shared. Your individual genomic data, voice data and health information will be put in a controlled-access database.

To minimize this risk, we keep the session length short (less than 15 minutes).  If you feel uncomfortable, you can stop participation right away, or pause a session and resume at a later time.  If you tell us that you need support, we can contact your clinical care team.\nParticipation in this study involves the collection of: your voice, speech, and respiratory sound recordings (voice collection is a safe non-invasive collection method with minimal physical and psychological risk); demographic, clinical, and imaging data from your existing medical record; and survey/questionnaire responses. Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not want to answer. If you feel you have suffered an injury, which may include emotional trauma, as a result of participating in this study, please contact the person in charge of this study as soon as possible.\nEach individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features. Hence there is a risk of the participant being identified based on the unique features of their voice. However, the confidentiality of records that could identify subjects will be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Risks to the participants will be minimized by strict adherence to confidentiality rules. All voice recordings will be stored in a controlled-access HIPAA compliant blob storage in NIH STRIDES Bridge2AI Cloud Infrastructure in Azure whereas their path location and associated metadata will be kept in a controlled-access database (REDCap). Only researchers and institutions part of the data sharing agreement will have access to the data.\u00a0If you consent below to share your voice recordings to be open-source, only then every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use\u00a0de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open datasets from the acquired data.\n\nThere are some possible risks to learning information from genome sequencing or genotyping. It is possible that you may experience distress from learning about your genome sequencing or genotyping results. Even with protections in place, there is a small risk that your information could be released by accident. There is a small risk that your genetic data could be linked back to you or your blood relatives if it were linked back to your personal information. These results might contain information (e.g. an inherited genetic disease) that could have unintended consequences for you or your relatives. There is no way to predict what effects such an information loss would have. \n\nThe OHIP number is needed to link the data to administrative databases for any follow-up research in this study related to Alzheimer’s disease. Only the PI and delegates will have access to identifiable information including OHIP number. OHIP numbers will not be released to the sponsor and will be kept for safeguard on site, thus the linkage will be done through the PI.\n\nThere is possibility of linkage to many administrative databases other than ICES including but not limited to public health, CIHI and others that may become available in the future. There is always a small risk that your data may lead to you being re-identified one day. As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking data back to you that we cannot foresee today, in spite of the strict security measures. The potential re-identification or unintentional release of your genetic and clinical research data could lead to loss of privacy and to possible future discrimination against you or your biological relatives.\n\nIf you experience distress related to study results (positive or negative) the study genetic counsellor will discuss this distress with you. If necessary, you will be provided online and phone contact information for patient support groups. \u00a0If you seem overwhelmed, the genetic counsellor will ask if you would like a referral to a mental health specialist for more long-term support including a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nIf the genetic counsellor feels that you need immediate mental health service, they will refer you to the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.\u00a0 In this case, the genetic counsellor will work with you to ensure you receive follow up care.\u00a0 In addition, you are always free to refuse to answer any particular questions at any time if you feel uncomfortable.\n\nSince distress may occur at any time during the study, please contact the study team if at any time you experience any distress as a result of the study. We will put you in touch with the study genetic counsellor, who will ensure that the appropriate care is delivered.\n\nIf you choose to share your results with a designated family member or others, it may affect how they feel about you, or how you feel about them. For these reasons, you and your family may wish to seek further counseling. In some cases, you may want to see a mental health professional. \nThere is a chance that your genetic information may be used against you or your family members. This is a form of discrimination. Canada recently passed a legislation (Bill S-201) that makes genetic discrimination illegal. For instance, it is illegal for insurance companies, employers or other parties to use genetic testing results against you, or to force you to reveal the result of a genetic test. However, we cannot guarantee that no one will ever use your research test results against you. \nYour participation in this study is confidential; however, there is a small chance that your genetic data (results from genomic sequencing) could identify you or your family members. This is because each person’s genetic make-up is unique, similar to a fingerprint. Because your family’s genetic make-up is very similar to yours this means that your sequencing data could potentially identify them. We will do everything to ensure that your identity is protected; but because of the uniqueness of your genetic data we cannot guarantee confidentiality for you or your family members. \nThere could be bleeding or bruising caused by drawing blood. This is a small risk and almost never causes a problem.\n\nParticipation in this study, and the details of any decisions you make about your participation, will in no way affect any aspect of the care you are receiving from Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, or any other participating sites and associated hospitals and clinics, any hospital, health care facility or any medical staff.\n' (INVALID)
