Think of a single issue, feeling, emotion or symptom you have been experiencing lately. For example, sadness, fatigue, anxiety, loneliness, sleep issues, concentration issues, agitation, motivation, numbness, guilt, shame. If you are not experiencing anything negative, think of a positive one such as calmness or gratitude. Then describe how it shows up for you mentally and physically, what you see as its causes, and what situations trigger it.​​

He dresses himself in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons; yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever. A long, flowing beard clings to his chin, giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect. When he speaks his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle. Twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon our small organ. Except in the winter when the ooze or snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day. We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, “Banana Oil!” Grandfather likes to be modern in his language. </td><td>routine</td></tr><tr><td style="display: none">*</td><td>1.8.4</td><td>Task 4: Picture descriptions.</td><td>We're adding cross-sectional writing prompts, to get linguistic markers without speech.

    How do you want to be remembered at the end of your life by the people who know you well?  
    What were some of the happiest moments of your life? Where were you? What happened? Why did they make you happy? 
    Describe something good that happened in the last month (big or small)? Maybe you helped someone or there was some good news or there was a moment of joy and peace. Where were you, what happened, how did you feel? 
    How have you grown in the past? Have you learned important lessons about yourself? 
    Please think about your best possible social and professional self in the next month. Imagine that everything will go as well as it possibly can. Let your creativity flow and describe what exactly would improve, how your daily routine would be, and how you would feel.  
    Describe something that makes you happy. Are you with someone or by yourself? How do you feel? Why does it make you happy? Can you do this often?
