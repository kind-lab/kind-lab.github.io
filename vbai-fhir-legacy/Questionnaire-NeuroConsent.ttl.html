Please read the information about the study presented in this form. The form includes details on study’s risks and benefits that you should know before you decide if you would like to take part. You should take as much time as you need to make your decision. You should ask the study doctor or study staff to explain anything that you do not understand and make sure that all of your questions have been answered before signing this consent form.  Before you make your decision, feel free to talk about this study with anyone you wish including your friends, family, and family doctor.  \n\nTaking part in this study is voluntary. You have the option to not participate at all or you may choose to leave the study at any time. Whatever you choose, it will not affect the usual medical care that you receive outside the study. \n\nThe sections in this Introduction provide the basic information about the study. More detailed information is provided in the remainder of the document. This study is conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), University of Toronto (UofT), University of South Florida (USF), Weil Cornell Medicine (WCM), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), , Hospitals for Sick Children (HSC), Simon Fraser University (SFU), Hasting Center, Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and Washington University (WashU) and is supported/sponsored by The National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nEach individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features that have been linked to various health conditions, including mood disorders, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and some cancers. Recent advances in voice analysis technology, in particular those linked to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), have shed new insights into the detection of diseases by studying changes in voice and speech. As a biomarker, voice is unique, cost-effective, easy, and safe to collect in low resource settings.  Moreover, the human voice not only contains speech, but also other biomarkers such as respiratory sounds, and cough. The Bridge2AI-Voice as a Biomarker of Health, funded by NIH, aims to integrate voice as a biomarker of health into clinical care by creating a substantial multi-institutional voice database. This resource will fuel voice AI research, predictive modeling, disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The primary goal of the study is to build an ethically sourced, diverse database of human voices, speech, and respiratory sounds linked to health biomarkers using a secure mobile/tablet application and IT infrastructure with federated learning for data privacy. Multi-institutional collaborations between voice experts, AI engineers, bioethicists, and social scientists promote ethical data sourcing. The app will integrate voice data with imaging, demographics, and genomics and federated learning will enable collaborative research without sharing raw or private data. The Bridge2AI-Voice Consortium focuses on voice changes associated with five disease categories (respiratory disorders, voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders, and pediatric voice and speech disorders) in patients at USF specialty clinics and participating institutions. This research study being conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and University of Toronto (UofT), will focus specifically on Neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Collaborations with High Volume Expert Clinics and Community Clinics ensure database diversity. The four-year project spans 11 academic sites in the US and Canada, with potential expansions. De-identified voice and clinical data will be accessible on a cloud-based infrastructure for future Voice AI research.\n\nThe secondary goal of this study is to find potential genetic links between changes in voice, speech and language among individuals affected by cognitive impairment and the development and advancement of Alzheimer’s disease. For this purpose, whole genome sequencing or genotyping of specific genes will be performed to find out if there are any genetic variations that are responsible for your disease. Your genome data will then be used to create a genomic database and your genomic data will be stored in a controlled-access genomic databank (such as dbGaP) to link it to your voice data. Whole genome sequencing and genotyping are advanced techniques used to analyze your genetic information. Whole genome sequencing involves reading and interpreting all the genes present in your entire DNA. This helps researchers understand your genetic makeup, which can provide valuable insights into potential health risks. On the other hand, genotyping focuses on specific genes or DNA variants of interest. It allows us to pinpoint particular genetic variations that may be relevant to your disease. Both methods involve collecting a small sample of your DNA, typically through a blood sample. \n\nAdditionally, we would like to inform you that if, in the future, we develop a safe and effective method for returning the results of your genome test, we may reach out to you. This is to ensure that you have the opportunity to learn about any significant findings that could be relevant to your health or well-being.

The study team are trying to see whether voice has biomarkers for your particular disease that could be screened and differentiated through AI machine learning algorithms by building a large, ethically sourced, and diverse secure database of related voice recordings. To do this, we need to record language, speech and voice from individuals with cognitive impairment.  A smartphone/tablet application will be used to collect these data from older adults. To protect participants' privacy, all voice recordings and associated data will be stripped of identifiable information (such as Name, Address and other identifying information) before uploading them to a secure controlled-access database with access limited only to researchers and institutions part of the study. Every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open-source datasets from the acquired data.\nIt's important to note that you have the right to withdraw at any point, and in that scenario, only the data collected before your withdrawal will be stored in the database. The minimal requirement for participation is 1 data collection time-point.\nDemographic information, such as age, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and language, will be collected through a survey in the smartphone/tablet application. We may also collect different types of imaging data, such as brain CT scans and brain MRIs from your medical records. Please note that no imaging will be performed as part of this study, and we will only collect and review previously completed imaging data from your chart. In addition to data collection, you may be asked to answer surveys and/or validated questionnaires related to your diagnosis.\nWe also want to find out if there are any potential genetic links between changes in language, speech, and voice among individuals affected by cognitive impairment and the development and advancement of disease. For this purpose, we will obtain a sample of your blood to extract DNA for whole genome sequencing or genotyping. Your individual genomic data and health information will be put in a controlled-access database. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. Your genomic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you.  This will enable researchers who are provided with access to use this valuable resource for future research in Alzheimer’s disease and other related diseases. We would also conduct analysis of specific genes related to Alzheimer’s disease and Mild cognitive impairment and correlate it with your voice and speech data. We will identify if there are any potential genetic links between changes in your voice and development and advancement of Alzheimer’s disease. We would like to find out about your interest in learning about genome results on genetic variations relevant to your disease which may impact your health or the health of your family. We would also like to find out about your interest in learning about “incidental findings”, which is genetic information that can be discovered during this testing about you, which is not directly related to your disease, but which may be significant for your health and well-being. These findings could be associated with a large number of rare diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, or common diseases, like heart disease. However, at this time, we will not be returning genetic test results to you. If incidental findings or genetic variations relevant to your disease are found through your DNA analysis done above, the clinical team will look over these results to determine whether these findings can safely and effectively be interpreted for you. If the information can safely and effectively be interpreted, we may re-contact interested individuals in the future to explain which genetic variations relevant to your disease were found or any “incidental findings”, how they may affect your health, and to get your permission to have this information returned to you. Please indicate at the end of the consent form if you would like to be re-contacted for this purpose in the future.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-display\&quot;&gt;display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck11.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.4.1\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-group.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Group\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; 4.1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;Audio Data Collection&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-group\&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: white\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck110.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.Beginning-of-study visit (session 1)\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vline.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-display.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: white; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Display\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; Beginning-of-study visit (session 1)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;    • You will be introduced to the study, and provided a chance to ask questions.

The requisition forms will contain your unique study ID, date of birth, and gender. You will be asked to take this Requisition Form along with the barcoded sheet (if required) to either the hospital where you were seen for Alzheimer’s disease or at a phlebotomy clinic, such as LifeLabs or Dynacare. Blood samples will be taken by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. Up to 10 mL per tube (2 tubes) of blood will be collected. The lab where you have your blood drawn will attach the barcodes provided to the tubes used to collect your blood sample. Samples collected will then be transferred to Sinai Health System for whole genome sequencing or genotyping. If there is already a sample or DNA being stored at the hospital where you received care, or as part of another research study, we may also be able to use that sample. Samples will be transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital for analysis. If a similar test such as whole genome sequencing or genotyping was done elsewhere either through clinical testing as part of your routine care or as part of a different research study, we will request that data from those tests be shared with our research team. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-display\&quot;&gt;display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: white\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck10.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.4.2.1 How will blood samples be identified?\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-display.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: white; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Display\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; 4.2.1 How will blood samples be identified?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;The requisition forms for the blood samples will include your DOB and gender and will be sent to Mount Sinai for clinical analyses through the clinical channels or courier shipment. The DOB and gender is needed on the requisition forms for verification purposes. Once the samples are here at Mount Sinai and the clinical testing is done, the research sample will be de-identified with a unique research ID. Information that can identify you such as your name, date of birth, health card number, address and phone number will be removed from your sample and your samples will be coded with a unique study ID to protect your identity. A keycode that can link the research identifier back to you will be kept securely at Sinai Health System so that we can link back data identified from this research to return to you, if appropriate, on a research report. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-display\&quot;&gt;display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck10.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.4.2.2 Provision (or return) of Genetic Results\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-display.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Display\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; 4.2.2 Provision (or return) of Genetic Results&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;Assuming you or your next of kin has given permission below to receive updates regarding the delivery of your genomic test results, and in the event that we are able to ensure a secure and efficient method for delivering the results, it is expected that the results will be available to the participant over the course of the study. \n\nDepending on your genome sequencing or genotyping results, the study coordinator may contact you to set up a meeting with a genetic counsellor to discuss your results. In the event, the participant is not able to understand the results from their genomic reports, this information will be returned to the next of kin. \nMeetings with the genetic counsellor may occur over the phone or through videoconferencing. In the meeting you will be given results depending on your preferences as provided to the study team. The genetic counsellor will arrange for appropriate referrals and follow-up where necessary. We may send a copy of your results to your family doctor with your permission. If your genome sequencing or genotyping results do not require urgent follow-up or a meeting with a genetic counsellor, you will receive a copy of your results with a letter from the genetic counsellor by mail or through secure download link via email (depending on your preference). You will have the option to arrange a follow-up call with the genetic counsellor to discuss your results if you wish. Your research report and results could be revised to include additional information over the course of the study.

We will conduct analysis of specific genes related to Alzheimer and/or Mild cognitive impairment to correlate it with your voice and speech data. \nStoring of the Genomic data in a controlled-access genomic databank such as dbGaP is mandatory and fundamental to this study. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. Your genomic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you.\n\ndbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) is a databank developed and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) that stores and provides access to data from genetic studies that are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Data in the Genomic Databank is stored on cloud servers located in USA. It is a controlled access databank that is restricted and requires permission or authorization to access its data. dbGaP has strict policies in place to protect your privacy as a research participant. These policies ensure that data submitted to dbGaP is de-identified, and that researchers who access the data must sign a data use agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for using the data. Access to the data is granted through a review process by NCBI and is subject to strict safeguards to protect your privacy as a research participant.\n\nGeneral research results (such as number of participants in the study, diseases studied, age of the participants, etc.) and data that cannot be linked back to you will be available to other researchers in what we call an open access database, i.e. open to other members of the scientific and medical community.\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-display\&quot;&gt;display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck10.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.Consenting Procedure\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-display.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Display\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; Consenting Procedure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;A local coordinator or counsellor can recontact you to provide more information about the study as well as send out the consent form by email or regular mail or obtain consent verbally over the phone or obtain e-consent directly via the smartphone/tablet application. If the patient is too ill to consent on their own, a substitute decision maker such as next of kin, spouse or partner, relative under the patient’s care can consent. If the patient regains the ability to consent, the medical team will inform the study coordinator and the patient will be reconsented remotely for the study. The last page on the consent form about reconsenting will need to be filled out by the study coordinator.\n\nIf you choose email, you will be informed that the communication via email is not a secure form of communication. If you agree, then the study coordinator will obtain and confirm your email ID. If you choose the mail option, a return labeled enveloped will be sent with the consent form. The call for verbal consenting and review will be scheduled within a week of the initial call. If for any reason you have lost your copy of the consent form prior to speaking with the study coordinator, a new copy will be sent to you via email or mail. If you choose verbal consent then the study coordinator will obtain informed consent over the phone.\n\nAt the verbal consent session via telephone, the study coordinator will verbally review the information contained in the consent form and give you the opportunity to seek clarification on any points, if needed. Only after you demonstrate that you understand each section of the consent, you will be considered to have given consent. Not all aspects of the consent are mandatory; therefore, for each part of the consent you will verbally acknowledge your decision. If after reviewing the consent you would still like to take part in the study, the study coordinator will ask you to verbalize your consent by answering “yes” to the question “Is this all agreeable to you?” If you agree, you can sign and send back a copy of the signed consent by email, again with the understanding that email is not a secure form of communication or via mail. Once received, the study coordinator should sign their section (person obtaining consent) and send back a fully signed copy to you. \n\nIf you are not comfortable with consent being sent through email for obtaining signature, the option of sending the consent by mail will be offered. If that is not acceptable either, then verbal consent can also be obtained, provided the consent is documented and witnessed (through setting up a 3-way videoconferencing or phone call). You will be asked to retain a copy of the consent form for your record.  The study coordinator will sign the verbal consent script which will be kept in a separate secure location from the other study materials in the study offices at Mount Sinai Hospital. Consents will be kept in a locked file in the study office of Mount Sinai Hospital and will be destroyed after 25 years after study completion.\n\nIf the e-consent session is conducted via the smartphone/tablet application, then the study coordinator will guide you through the enrollment process where you will be introduced to the study, and will be asked questions regarding your diagnosis, other questions to determine if you fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria via the application. Then, the application will let you know if you are eligible to participate in the study followed by the consenting process. The informed consent form will be shown to you directly via the application and once reviewed, you will be able to click a button in the application to consent to the study or click a button to decline to not participate in the study. You will be able to ask any questions that come up to the study research coordinator throughout the enrollment and e-consenting process. \n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left;

You can choose to end your participation in this research (called withdrawal) at any time without having to provide a reason.  If you choose to withdraw from the study, for any reasons, you are encouraged to contact the Principal investigator or a member of the study team. This will not have any effect on the care you or your family will receive. \n\nYou may withdraw your permission to use information that was collected about you for this study at any time by letting the research team know. However, this would also mean that you withdraw from the study. \n\nDe-identified data or coded data that cannot be linked back to you and is shared with other researchers in any open access or controlled access databank in the future, may not deleted once it is shared. Your individual genomic data, voice data and health information will be put in a controlled-access database. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. Your genomic data, voice data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you. General research results (such as number of participants in the study, diseases studied, age of the participants, etc.) and data that cannot be linked back to you will be available to other researchers in what we call an open access database, i.e. open to other members of the scientific and medical community.\n\nIf you decide to withdraw from the study, data stored at Mount Sinai Hospital including the OHIP number will be destroyed. To protect participants' privacy, all voice recordings and associated data will be stripped of identifiable information before uploading them to a secure database. It's important to note that you have the right to withdraw at any point, and in that case, only the data collected before your withdrawal will be stored in the database.  Any genomic data in the Genomic Database will not be able to be destroyed if the results have already been stored in the controlled-access Genomic Databank (such as dbGaP) at the time of your notification.

To minimize this risk, we keep the session length short (less than 15 minutes).  If you feel uncomfortable, you can stop participation right away, or pause a session and resume at a later time.  If you tell us that you need support, we can contact your clinical care team.\nParticipation in this study involves the collection of: your voice, speech, and respiratory sound recordings (voice collection is a safe non-invasive collection method with minimal physical and psychological risk); demographic, clinical, and imaging data from your existing medical record; and survey/questionnaire responses. Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not want to answer. If you feel you have suffered an injury, which may include emotional trauma, as a result of participating in this study, please contact the person in charge of this study as soon as possible.\nEach individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features. Hence there is a risk of the participant being identified based on the unique features of their voice. However, the confidentiality of records that could identify subjects will be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Risks to the participants will be minimized by strict adherence to confidentiality rules. All voice recordings will be stored in a controlled-access HIPAA compliant blob storage in NIH STRIDES Bridge2AI Cloud Infrastructure in Azure whereas their path location and associated metadata will be kept in a controlled-access database (REDCap). Only researchers and institutions part of the data sharing agreement will have access to the data. If you consent below to share your voice recordings to be open-source, only then every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open datasets from the acquired data.\n\nThere are some possible risks to learning information from genome sequencing or genotyping. It is possible that you may experience distress from learning about your genome sequencing or genotyping results. Even with protections in place, there is a small risk that your information could be released by accident. There is a small risk that your genetic data could be linked back to you or your blood relatives if it were linked back to your personal information. These results might contain information (e.g. an inherited genetic disease) that could have unintended consequences for you or your relatives. There is no way to predict what effects such an information loss would have. \n\nThe OHIP number is needed to link the data to administrative databases for any follow-up research in this study related to Alzheimer’s disease. Only the PI and delegates will have access to identifiable information including OHIP number. OHIP numbers will not be released to the sponsor and will be kept for safeguard on site, thus the linkage will be done through the PI.\n\nThere is possibility of linkage to many administrative databases other than ICES including but not limited to public health, CIHI and others that may become available in the future. There is always a small risk that your data may lead to you being re-identified one day. As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking data back to you that we cannot foresee today, in spite of the strict security measures. The potential re-identification or unintentional release of your genetic and clinical research data could lead to loss of privacy and to possible future discrimination against you or your biological relatives.\n\nIf you experience distress related to study results (positive or negative) the study genetic counsellor will discuss this distress with you. If necessary, you will be provided online and phone contact information for patient support groups.  If you seem overwhelmed, the genetic counsellor will ask if you would like a referral to a mental health specialist for more long-term support including a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nIf the genetic counsellor feels that you need immediate mental health service, they will refer you to the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.  In this case, the genetic counsellor will work with you to ensure you receive follow up care.  In addition, you are always free to refuse to answer any particular questions at any time if you feel uncomfortable.\n\nSince distress may occur at any time during the study, please contact the study team if at any time you experience any distress as a result of the study. We will put you in touch with the study genetic counsellor, who will ensure that the appropriate care is delivered.\n\nIf you choose to share your results with a designated family member or others, it may affect how they feel about you, or how you feel about them. For these reasons, you and your family may wish to seek further counseling. In some cases, you may want to see a mental health professional. \nThere is a chance that your genetic information may be used against you or your family members. This is a form of discrimination. Canada recently passed a legislation (Bill S-201) that makes genetic discrimination illegal. For instance, it is illegal for insurance companies, employers or other parties to use genetic testing results against you, or to force you to reveal the result of a genetic test. However, we cannot guarantee that no one will ever use your research test results against you. \nYour participation in this study is confidential; however, there is a small chance that your genetic data (results from genomic sequencing) could identify you or your family members. This is because each person’s genetic make-up is unique, similar to a fingerprint. Because your family’s genetic make-up is very similar to yours this means that your sequencing data could potentially identify them. We will do everything to ensure that your identity is protected; but because of the uniqueness of your genetic data we cannot guarantee confidentiality for you or your family members. \nThere could be bleeding or bruising caused by drawing blood. This is a small risk and almost never causes a problem.\n\nParticipation in this study, and the details of any decisions you make about your participation, will in no way affect any aspect of the care you are receiving from Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, or any other participating sites and associated hospitals and clinics, any hospital, health care facility or any medical staff.\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-display\&quot;&gt;display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: white\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck10.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.What are the benefits of particpating in this study?\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-display.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: white; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Display\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; What are the benefits of particpating in this study?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;If you consent below to be contacted in the future regarding the return of your genomic test results, on the condition that a safe and effective way of returning your genome test results is identified, you may learn information about your disease and this might allow doctors to help manage your disease, or provide treatment options for your disease. It may also identify health risk information that might have implications for your relatives. \n\nYour participation will allow researchers to improve disease detection through voice, with positive outcomes for public health and health research. We hope the information learned from this study will help people with Alzheimer’s disease in the future. \n\nIf published in the scientific literature, our research findings may one day allow a commercial company to develop a test or a treatment for your condition. In the event that the study generates commercially viable intellectual property such as patents or software, no one directly involved in the study, including you and the investigators, will benefit financially as a result. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;0..1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-item-type.html#item-type-display\&quot;&gt;display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr style=\&quot;border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\&quot;&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(tbl_bck10.png)\&quot; id=\&quot;item.How will particpant information be kept confidential?\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_spacer.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;tbl_vjoin.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: inherit\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;icon-q-display.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;.\&quot; style=\&quot;background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\&quot; title=\&quot;Display\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;/&gt; How will particpant information be kept confidential?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 1px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\&quot; class=\&quot;hierarchy\&quot;&gt;If you agree to participate in this study, the study doctor and their study team will look at your personal health information and collect only the information they need for the study. Personal health information is any information that could be used to identify you and includes your:\n    • name, \n    • address, \n    • date of birth, \n    • New or existing medical records that includes types, dates and results of neuropsychological tests. \n\nStudy information that does not identify you will be collected through the language assessment, on the smartphone/tablet application. The software used will be password-protected. The responses you submit will be stored securely, using encryption. The collected data will be accessible only to the study investigators. \n\nThis study involves recording and storing voice. Speech recordings will be transcribed at the word level by either study investigators, automatic speech recognition software running on these servers, or both. We also hope to gather information on your tone, voice level, and use of pauses, to better understand your reaction to the program. All voice/speech and respiratory sound data will be uploaded to a secure database, which will be linked to a HIPPA protected server hosted at Weil Cornell Medicine and a STRIDE partner (https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) - the cloud-based system, which hosts the secure database, has pre-determined contracts with the NIH for data privacy. To protect participants' privacy, all voice recordings and associated data will be stripped of identifiable information before uploading them to the secure database. Only researchers and institutions part of the data sharing agreement will have access to the data. If you consent below to share your voice recordings to be open-source, only then every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open datasets from the acquired data. It's important to note that you have the right to withdraw at any point, and in that scenario, only the data collected before your withdrawal will be stored in the database.\n\nThe information that is collected for the study will be kept in a locked and secure area at Sinai Health System by the study doctor up to 25 years. Only the study team will be allowed to look at your records. Records identifying you at this Centre will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, will not be disclosed or made publicly available, except as described in this consent document.\n\nAuthorized representatives of the following organizations may look at your original (identifiable) records at the site where these records are held, to check that the information collected for the study is correct and follows proper laws and guidelines:\n    • The research ethics board at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, \n    • The following organizations will also receive study data and/or your samples: \n    • Sinai Health System (including Mount Sinai Hospital and the Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute) where samples will be stored and genome sequence data will be analyzed.\n    • The site where genome sequencing or genotyping will be done either at Mount Sinai or TCAG or any other participating site.\n    • National Institute of Health (NIH)\n\nInformation that is collected about you for the study (called study data) may also be sent to the organizations listed above. Your name, address, email, or other information that may directly identify you will not be used. The records received by these organizations may disclose identifiers e.g., participant code, initials, ancestry/ethnicity, sex, and age.\n\nIf the results of this study are published, your identity will remain confidential. It is expected that the information collected during this study will be used in analyses and will be published and presented to the scientific community at meetings and in journals.\n\nTo analyze your genetic data, the data analysis may be done in part on a Microsoft Azure data center, Google or Amazon Web Server data center hosted in Toronto or elsewhere in Canada, and also use a web based computing software program from a third party company. To use such software we will have to upload your sequence information. This will be the only information we will upload, and we will not upload any other information about you such as your name, date of birth or other information that could identify you. The software may use a server that resides in Canada, the United States (USA) or another country and will store your data in a way that is compliant with Canadian privacy protection standards. The software company will not own your data and once we terminate our contract with the software company we will remove your data from the software company's server.  \n\nIt is also possible that certain data will be uploaded to an open access (such as ClinVar or a population database) or controlled access databank (such as dbGaP) that helps scientists learn more about how genetics are linked to disease. If this data is uploaded, it will not contain any of your identifiable information. \n \nAny information sent outside of Canadian borders may increase the risk of disclosure of information because the laws in those countries dealing with protection of information may not be as strict as in Canada. However, all study data that are transferred outside of Canada will be coded (this means it will not contain your personal identifying information such as your name, address, medical health number or contact information). Any information will be transferred in compliance with all relevant Canadian privacy laws. By signing this consent form, you are consenting to the disclosure of your coded information to organizations located outside of Canada.\n\nYour genome sequence data will be used to create a genomic database and that data will be stored in a controlled-access Genomic databank such as dbGaP. Data in the Genomic Databank is under the responsibility of National Institute of Health (NIH). Data in the Genomic Databank is stored on cloud servers located in USA. The data stored in the Genomic Databank will be kept indefinitely. All your genetic and clinical data will be “de-identified”, before being sent to the Genomic Databank for storage, only the “study code key” can connect the information collected about you to your identity. This means that researchers accessing the Databank will not see your identifiable information (i.e., name, address, phone number, email, OHIP etc.).  The study code key, which links your identifiable information to the code, will be safeguarded by the Mount Sinai Hospital research team and will not be sent to the Genomic Databank.\n\nYour genomic data will be analyzed to look for specific gene alterations related to your disease. The results of this analysis will be a list of all of the changes (variants) found in your DNA that is relevant to your diagnosed disease. You cannot be identified from this type of data (the changes found). This data will be added to the general study data.\n \nAll study data, files and material will be kept at Sinai Health System in a secure area. All computer files will be kept on servers at Sinai Health System and will conform to all privacy and confidentiality laws.  \n\nSurvey data collected through the smartphone/tablet application will be stored in a secure database such as REDCap and only the researchers will have access to it that adheres to Mount Sinai’s Hospital research ethics standards of confidentiality. \n\nAll of the study data (questionnaires, results of sequencing analysis) will have any identifiable information removed. Each participant and their answers (data) will be assigned a specific code and only the principal investigator will have the “code key” which can link the codes back to the data. The code key will be kept on a secure server at Sinai Health System and will only be accessible to the principal investigator and other members of the research team.\n \nInformation that we transfer to our study offices will be done manually by our study staff. Study data will be uploaded onto an encrypted (password protected) USB key. Once the data is uploaded at Sinai Health System it will be erased off the USB. Data that is coded such as your genomic sequencing results will be transferred using secure file transfer.\n \nThe information that is collected for the study will be kept in a locked and secure area by the study doctor for up to 25 years. Only the study team or the people or groups listed below will be allowed to look at your records. Consent forms, study data, including contact information and sequencing data will be stored on the secure servers at Sinai Health System. We will retain all study data for up to 25 years after the completion of the study. However, this period could be extended indefinitely or until the information is no longer useful for research. \n\nEven though the likelihood that someone may identify you from the study data is very small, it can never be completely eliminated. Each individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features. Hence there is a risk of you being identified based on the unique features of your voice. However, the confidentiality of records that could identify subjects will be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Risks to the participants will be minimized by strict adherence to confidentiality rules. It is also important to note that the genomic sequencing data we gather from you is inherently identifiable if it is linked back to your other personal information (e.g. name, address) because it contains your unique genetic make-up. In order to protect your genomic sequencing data, we will de-identify the information, meaning we will remove any identifiable information, such as name and date of birth, from the data set. However, because the data contains your unique genetic make-up, the data can act as an identifier if it were linked back to your name or other personal information. \n\nIf you decide to participate in this study, the research team at the Mount Sinai Hospital (study investigators, coordinators, nurses, and delegates) will collect personal information about you, including OHIP number, personal health information from your medical records and other sources of clinical data, as well as your contact information (name, address, phone number, email) for the purposes of re-contacting you, if you agree to it.

We will not share your contact information with anyone. You would only be contacted by members of the study team. You may be re-contacted and invited to participate in follow-up research to get your feedback on this consent process. We may contact you to invite you to participate in other future research studies. We will provide you with additional information about new research studies and provide you with a separate consent form when we contact you. You can decline to take part in any future research when you are approached and are not obliged to participate if you have agreed to be re-contacted. If you agree now but change your mind later to be re-contacted you can remove yourself from this list at any time by contacting the principle investigator or the study coordinator. If you do not wish to be re-contacted you can still take part in this study. We will keep your re-contact information for up to 25 years, after which time we will no longer contact you without your permission.\nI understand that I may be contacted in the future to learn about genetic test results. On the condition that we are able to find a safe and effective way of returning information to you about your genetic test result, please indicate your willingness to be re-contacted regarding the return of this information to you below:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=\&quot;vertical-align: top;

Please read the information about the study presented in this form. The form includes details on study’s risks and benefits that you should know before you decide if you would like to take part. You should take as much time as you need to make your decision. You should ask the study doctor or study staff to explain anything that you do not understand and make sure that all of your questions have been answered before signing this consent form.  Before you make your decision, feel free to talk about this study with anyone you wish including your friends, family, and family doctor.  \n\nTaking part in this study is voluntary. You have the option to not participate at all or you may choose to leave the study at any time. Whatever you choose, it will not affect the usual medical care that you receive outside the study. \n\nThe sections in this Introduction provide the basic information about the study. More detailed information is provided in the remainder of the document. This study is conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH), University of Toronto (UofT), University of South Florida (USF), Weil Cornell Medicine (WCM), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), , Hospitals for Sick Children (HSC), Simon Fraser University (SFU), Hasting Center, Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and Washington University (WashU) and is supported/sponsored by The National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nEach individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features that have been linked to various health conditions, including mood disorders, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and some cancers. Recent advances in voice analysis technology, in particular those linked to machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), have shed new insights into the detection of diseases by studying changes in voice and speech. As a biomarker, voice is unique, cost-effective, easy, and safe to collect in low resource settings.  Moreover, the human voice not only contains speech, but also other biomarkers such as respiratory sounds, and cough. The Bridge2AI-Voice as a Biomarker of Health, funded by NIH, aims to integrate voice as a biomarker of health into clinical care by creating a substantial multi-institutional voice database. This resource will fuel voice AI research, predictive modeling, disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The primary goal of the study is to build an ethically sourced, diverse database of human voices, speech, and respiratory sounds linked to health biomarkers using a secure mobile/tablet application and IT infrastructure with federated learning for data privacy. Multi-institutional collaborations between voice experts, AI engineers, bioethicists, and social scientists promote ethical data sourcing. The app will integrate voice data with imaging, demographics, and genomics and federated learning will enable collaborative research without sharing raw or private data. The Bridge2AI-Voice Consortium focuses on voice changes associated with five disease categories (respiratory disorders, voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders, and pediatric voice and speech disorders) in patients at USF specialty clinics and participating institutions. This research study being conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and University of Toronto (UofT), will focus specifically on Neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Collaborations with High Volume Expert Clinics and Community Clinics ensure database diversity. The four-year project spans 11 academic sites in the US and Canada, with potential expansions. De-identified voice and clinical data will be accessible on a cloud-based infrastructure for future Voice AI research.\n\nThe secondary goal of this study is to find potential genetic links between changes in voice, speech and language among individuals affected by cognitive impairment and the development and advancement of Alzheimer’s disease. For this purpose, whole genome sequencing or genotyping of specific genes will be performed to find out if there are any genetic variations that are responsible for your disease. Your genome data will then be used to create a genomic database and your genomic data will be stored in a controlled-access genomic databank (such as dbGaP) to link it to your voice data. Whole genome sequencing and genotyping are advanced techniques used to analyze your genetic information. Whole genome sequencing involves reading and interpreting all the genes present in your entire DNA. This helps researchers understand your genetic makeup, which can provide valuable insights into potential health risks. On the other hand, genotyping focuses on specific genes or DNA variants of interest. It allows us to pinpoint particular genetic variations that may be relevant to your disease. Both methods involve collecting a small sample of your DNA, typically through a blood sample. \n\nAdditionally, we would like to inform you that if, in the future, we develop a safe and effective method for returning the results of your genome test, we may reach out to you. This is to ensure that you have the opportunity to learn about any significant findings that could be relevant to your health or well-being. Please be assured that any communication regarding the delivery of these results will be conducted with utmost care and respect for your privacy. We value your participation and understand the importance of keeping you informed about the potential implications of the genetic information obtained through whole genome sequencing or genotyping.  \n\nThe overall goal of this project is to find speech biomarkers for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease by collaborating with experts in data science, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze information, and to link it to multimodal health biomarkers (such as imaging, demographics and genomics). This research could lead to better screening, detection, prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n&quot; ] ;

The study team are trying to see whether voice has biomarkers for your particular disease that could be screened and differentiated through AI machine learning algorithms by building a large, ethically sourced, and diverse secure database of related voice recordings. To do this, we need to record language, speech and voice from individuals with cognitive impairment.  A smartphone/tablet application will be used to collect these data from older adults. To protect participants' privacy, all voice recordings and associated data will be stripped of identifiable information (such as Name, Address and other identifying information) before uploading them to a secure controlled-access database with access limited only to researchers and institutions part of the study. Every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open-source datasets from the acquired data.\nIt's important to note that you have the right to withdraw at any point, and in that scenario, only the data collected before your withdrawal will be stored in the database. The minimal requirement for participation is 1 data collection time-point.\nDemographic information, such as age, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and language, will be collected through a survey in the smartphone/tablet application. We may also collect different types of imaging data, such as brain CT scans and brain MRIs from your medical records. Please note that no imaging will be performed as part of this study, and we will only collect and review previously completed imaging data from your chart. In addition to data collection, you may be asked to answer surveys and/or validated questionnaires related to your diagnosis.\nWe also want to find out if there are any potential genetic links between changes in language, speech, and voice among individuals affected by cognitive impairment and the development and advancement of disease. For this purpose, we will obtain a sample of your blood to extract DNA for whole genome sequencing or genotyping. Your individual genomic data and health information will be put in a controlled-access database. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. Your genomic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you.  This will enable researchers who are provided with access to use this valuable resource for future research in Alzheimer’s disease and other related diseases. We would also conduct analysis of specific genes related to Alzheimer’s disease and Mild cognitive impairment and correlate it with your voice and speech data. We will identify if there are any potential genetic links between changes in your voice and development and advancement of Alzheimer’s disease. We would like to find out about your interest in learning about genome results on genetic variations relevant to your disease which may impact your health or the health of your family. We would also like to find out about your interest in learning about “incidental findings”, which is genetic information that can be discovered during this testing about you, which is not directly related to your disease, but which may be significant for your health and well-being. These findings could be associated with a large number of rare diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, or common diseases, like heart disease. However, at this time, we will not be returning genetic test results to you. If incidental findings or genetic variations relevant to your disease are found through your DNA analysis done above, the clinical team will look over these results to determine whether these findings can safely and effectively be interpreted for you. If the information can safely and effectively be interpreted, we may re-contact interested individuals in the future to explain which genetic variations relevant to your disease were found or any “incidental findings”, how they may affect your health, and to get your permission to have this information returned to you. Please indicate at the end of the consent form if you would like to be re-contacted for this purpose in the future.&quot; ] ;

We will conduct analysis of specific genes related to Alzheimer and/or Mild cognitive impairment to correlate it with your voice and speech data. \nStoring of the Genomic data in a controlled-access genomic databank such as dbGaP is mandatory and fundamental to this study. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. Your genomic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you.\n\ndbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) is a databank developed and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) that stores and provides access to data from genetic studies that are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Data in the Genomic Databank is stored on cloud servers located in USA. It is a controlled access databank that is restricted and requires permission or authorization to access its data. dbGaP has strict policies in place to protect your privacy as a research participant. These policies ensure that data submitted to dbGaP is de-identified, and that researchers who access the data must sign a data use agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for using the data. Access to the data is granted through a review process by NCBI and is subject to strict safeguards to protect your privacy as a research participant.\n\nGeneral research results (such as number of participants in the study, diseases studied, age of the participants, etc.) and data that cannot be linked back to you will be available to other researchers in what we call an open access database, i.e. open to other members of the scientific and medical community.\n&quot; ] ;

If the patient is too ill to consent on their own, a substitute decision maker such as next of kin, spouse or partner, relative under the patient’s care can consent. If the patient regains the ability to consent, the medical team will inform the study coordinator and the patient will be reconsented remotely for the study. The last page on the consent form about reconsenting will need to be filled out by the study coordinator.\n\nIf you choose email, you will be informed that the communication via email is not a secure form of communication. If you agree, then the study coordinator will obtain and confirm your email ID. If you choose the mail option, a return labeled enveloped will be sent with the consent form. The call for verbal consenting and review will be scheduled within a week of the initial call. If for any reason you have lost your copy of the consent form prior to speaking with the study coordinator, a new copy will be sent to you via email or mail. If you choose verbal consent then the study coordinator will obtain informed consent over the phone.\n\nAt the verbal consent session via telephone, the study coordinator will verbally review the information contained in the consent form and give you the opportunity to seek clarification on any points, if needed. Only after you demonstrate that you understand each section of the consent, you will be considered to have given consent. Not all aspects of the consent are mandatory; therefore, for each part of the consent you will verbally acknowledge your decision. If after reviewing the consent you would still like to take part in the study, the study coordinator will ask you to verbalize your consent by answering “yes” to the question “Is this all agreeable to you?” If you agree, you can sign and send back a copy of the signed consent by email, again with the understanding that email is not a secure form of communication or via mail. Once received, the study coordinator should sign their section (person obtaining consent) and send back a fully signed copy to you. \n\nIf you are not comfortable with consent being sent through email for obtaining signature, the option of sending the consent by mail will be offered. If that is not acceptable either, then verbal consent can also be obtained, provided the consent is documented and witnessed (through setting up a 3-way videoconferencing or phone call). You will be asked to retain a copy of the consent form for your record.  The study coordinator will sign the verbal consent script which will be kept in a separate secure location from the other study materials in the study offices at Mount Sinai Hospital. Consents will be kept in a locked file in the study office of Mount Sinai Hospital and will be destroyed after 25 years after study completion.\n\nIf the e-consent session is conducted via the smartphone/tablet application, then the study coordinator will guide you through the enrollment process where you will be introduced to the study, and will be asked questions regarding your diagnosis, other questions to determine if you fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria via the application. Then, the application will let you know if you are eligible to participate in the study followed by the consenting process. The informed consent form will be shown to you directly via the application and once reviewed, you will be able to click a button in the application to consent to the study or click a button to decline to not participate in the study. You will be able to ask any questions that come up to the study research coordinator throughout the enrollment and e-consenting process. \n&quot; ] ;

If you tell us that you need support, we can contact your clinical care team.\nParticipation in this study involves the collection of: your voice, speech, and respiratory sound recordings (voice collection is a safe non-invasive collection method with minimal physical and psychological risk); demographic, clinical, and imaging data from your existing medical record; and survey/questionnaire responses. Some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. Know that the information you provide is entirely up to you and you are free to skip questions that you do not want to answer. If you feel you have suffered an injury, which may include emotional trauma, as a result of participating in this study, please contact the person in charge of this study as soon as possible.\nEach individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features. Hence there is a risk of the participant being identified based on the unique features of their voice. However, the confidentiality of records that could identify subjects will be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Risks to the participants will be minimized by strict adherence to confidentiality rules. All voice recordings will be stored in a controlled-access HIPAA compliant blob storage in NIH STRIDES Bridge2AI Cloud Infrastructure in Azure whereas their path location and associated metadata will be kept in a controlled-access database (REDCap). Only researchers and institutions part of the data sharing agreement will have access to the data. If you consent below to share your voice recordings to be open-source, only then every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open datasets from the acquired data.\n\nThere are some possible risks to learning information from genome sequencing or genotyping. It is possible that you may experience distress from learning about your genome sequencing or genotyping results. Even with protections in place, there is a small risk that your information could be released by accident. There is a small risk that your genetic data could be linked back to you or your blood relatives if it were linked back to your personal information. These results might contain information (e.g. an inherited genetic disease) that could have unintended consequences for you or your relatives. There is no way to predict what effects such an information loss would have. \n\nThe OHIP number is needed to link the data to administrative databases for any follow-up research in this study related to Alzheimer’s disease. Only the PI and delegates will have access to identifiable information including OHIP number. OHIP numbers will not be released to the sponsor and will be kept for safeguard on site, thus the linkage will be done through the PI.\n\nThere is possibility of linkage to many administrative databases other than ICES including but not limited to public health, CIHI and others that may become available in the future. There is always a small risk that your data may lead to you being re-identified one day. As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking data back to you that we cannot foresee today, in spite of the strict security measures. The potential re-identification or unintentional release of your genetic and clinical research data could lead to loss of privacy and to possible future discrimination against you or your biological relatives.\n\nIf you experience distress related to study results (positive or negative) the study genetic counsellor will discuss this distress with you. If necessary, you will be provided online and phone contact information for patient support groups.  If you seem overwhelmed, the genetic counsellor will ask if you would like a referral to a mental health specialist for more long-term support including a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nIf the genetic counsellor feels that you need immediate mental health service, they will refer you to the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.  In this case, the genetic counsellor will work with you to ensure you receive follow up care.  In addition, you are always free to refuse to answer any particular questions at any time if you feel uncomfortable.\n\nSince distress may occur at any time during the study, please contact the study team if at any time you experience any distress as a result of the study. We will put you in touch with the study genetic counsellor, who will ensure that the appropriate care is delivered.\n\nIf you choose to share your results with a designated family member or others, it may affect how they feel about you, or how you feel about them. For these reasons, you and your family may wish to seek further counseling. In some cases, you may want to see a mental health professional. \nThere is a chance that your genetic information may be used against you or your family members. This is a form of discrimination. Canada recently passed a legislation (Bill S-201) that makes genetic discrimination illegal. For instance, it is illegal for insurance companies, employers or other parties to use genetic testing results against you, or to force you to reveal the result of a genetic test. However, we cannot guarantee that no one will ever use your research test results against you. \nYour participation in this study is confidential; however, there is a small chance that your genetic data (results from genomic sequencing) could identify you or your family members. This is because each person’s genetic make-up is unique, similar to a fingerprint. Because your family’s genetic make-up is very similar to yours this means that your sequencing data could potentially identify them. We will do everything to ensure that your identity is protected; but because of the uniqueness of your genetic data we cannot guarantee confidentiality for you or your family members. \nThere could be bleeding or bruising caused by drawing blood. This is a small risk and almost never causes a problem.\n\nParticipation in this study, and the details of any decisions you make about your participation, will in no way affect any aspect of the care you are receiving from Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, or any other participating sites and associated hospitals and clinics, any hospital, health care facility or any medical staff.\n&quot; ] ;

Personal health information is any information that could be used to identify you and includes your:\n    • name, \n    • address, \n    • date of birth, \n    • New or existing medical records that includes types, dates and results of neuropsychological tests. \n\nStudy information that does not identify you will be collected through the language assessment, on the smartphone/tablet application. The software used will be password-protected. The responses you submit will be stored securely, using encryption. The collected data will be accessible only to the study investigators. \n\nThis study involves recording and storing voice. Speech recordings will be transcribed at the word level by either study investigators, automatic speech recognition software running on these servers, or both. We also hope to gather information on your tone, voice level, and use of pauses, to better understand your reaction to the program. All voice/speech and respiratory sound data will be uploaded to a secure database, which will be linked to a HIPPA protected server hosted at Weil Cornell Medicine and a STRIDE partner (https://datascience.nih.gov/strides) - the cloud-based system, which hosts the secure database, has pre-determined contracts with the NIH for data privacy. To protect participants' privacy, all voice recordings and associated data will be stripped of identifiable information before uploading them to the secure database. Only researchers and institutions part of the data sharing agreement will have access to the data. If you consent below to share your voice recordings to be open-source, only then every 6 months, data from the project will be released on an open source platform from the NIH with de-identified data. We will use de-identification strategies such as voice anonymization techniques that will allow creating open datasets from the acquired data. It's important to note that you have the right to withdraw at any point, and in that scenario, only the data collected before your withdrawal will be stored in the database.\n\nThe information that is collected for the study will be kept in a locked and secure area at Sinai Health System by the study doctor up to 25 years. Only the study team will be allowed to look at your records. Records identifying you at this Centre will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, will not be disclosed or made publicly available, except as described in this consent document.\n\nAuthorized representatives of the following organizations may look at your original (identifiable) records at the site where these records are held, to check that the information collected for the study is correct and follows proper laws and guidelines:\n    • The research ethics board at Mount Sinai Hospital, Sinai Health System, \n    • The following organizations will also receive study data and/or your samples: \n    • Sinai Health System (including Mount Sinai Hospital and the Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute) where samples will be stored and genome sequence data will be analyzed.\n    • The site where genome sequencing or genotyping will be done either at Mount Sinai or TCAG or any other participating site.\n    • National Institute of Health (NIH)\n\nInformation that is collected about you for the study (called study data) may also be sent to the organizations listed above. Your name, address, email, or other information that may directly identify you will not be used. The records received by these organizations may disclose identifiers e.g., participant code, initials, ancestry/ethnicity, sex, and age.\n\nIf the results of this study are published, your identity will remain confidential. It is expected that the information collected during this study will be used in analyses and will be published and presented to the scientific community at meetings and in journals.\n\nTo analyze your genetic data, the data analysis may be done in part on a Microsoft Azure data center, Google or Amazon Web Server data center hosted in Toronto or elsewhere in Canada, and also use a web based computing software program from a third party company. To use such software we will have to upload your sequence information. This will be the only information we will upload, and we will not upload any other information about you such as your name, date of birth or other information that could identify you. The software may use a server that resides in Canada, the United States (USA) or another country and will store your data in a way that is compliant with Canadian privacy protection standards. The software company will not own your data and once we terminate our contract with the software company we will remove your data from the software company's server.  \n\nIt is also possible that certain data will be uploaded to an open access (such as ClinVar or a population database) or controlled access databank (such as dbGaP) that helps scientists learn more about how genetics are linked to disease. If this data is uploaded, it will not contain any of your identifiable information. \n \nAny information sent outside of Canadian borders may increase the risk of disclosure of information because the laws in those countries dealing with protection of information may not be as strict as in Canada. However, all study data that are transferred outside of Canada will be coded (this means it will not contain your personal identifying information such as your name, address, medical health number or contact information). Any information will be transferred in compliance with all relevant Canadian privacy laws. By signing this consent form, you are consenting to the disclosure of your coded information to organizations located outside of Canada.\n\nYour genome sequence data will be used to create a genomic database and that data will be stored in a controlled-access Genomic databank such as dbGaP. Data in the Genomic Databank is under the responsibility of National Institute of Health (NIH). Data in the Genomic Databank is stored on cloud servers located in USA. The data stored in the Genomic Databank will be kept indefinitely. All your genetic and clinical data will be “de-identified”, before being sent to the Genomic Databank for storage, only the “study code key” can connect the information collected about you to your identity. This means that researchers accessing the Databank will not see your identifiable information (i.e., name, address, phone number, email, OHIP etc.).  The study code key, which links your identifiable information to the code, will be safeguarded by the Mount Sinai Hospital research team and will not be sent to the Genomic Databank.\n\nYour genomic data will be analyzed to look for specific gene alterations related to your disease. The results of this analysis will be a list of all of the changes (variants) found in your DNA that is relevant to your diagnosed disease. You cannot be identified from this type of data (the changes found). This data will be added to the general study data.\n \nAll study data, files and material will be kept at Sinai Health System in a secure area. All computer files will be kept on servers at Sinai Health System and will conform to all privacy and confidentiality laws.  \n\nSurvey data collected through the smartphone/tablet application will be stored in a secure database such as REDCap and only the researchers will have access to it that adheres to Mount Sinai’s Hospital research ethics standards of confidentiality. \n\nAll of the study data (questionnaires, results of sequencing analysis) will have any identifiable information removed. Each participant and their answers (data) will be assigned a specific code and only the principal investigator will have the “code key” which can link the codes back to the data. The code key will be kept on a secure server at Sinai Health System and will only be accessible to the principal investigator and other members of the research team.\n \nInformation that we transfer to our study offices will be done manually by our study staff. Study data will be uploaded onto an encrypted (password protected) USB key. Once the data is uploaded at Sinai Health System it will be erased off the USB. Data that is coded such as your genomic sequencing results will be transferred using secure file transfer.\n \nThe information that is collected for the study will be kept in a locked and secure area by the study doctor for up to 25 years. Only the study team or the people or groups listed below will be allowed to look at your records. Consent forms, study data, including contact information and sequencing data will be stored on the secure servers at Sinai Health System. We will retain all study data for up to 25 years after the completion of the study. However, this period could be extended indefinitely or until the information is no longer useful for research. \n\nEven though the likelihood that someone may identify you from the study data is very small, it can never be completely eliminated. Each individual's voice is unique and contains distinct audio features. Hence there is a risk of you being identified based on the unique features of your voice. However, the confidentiality of records that could identify subjects will be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Risks to the participants will be minimized by strict adherence to confidentiality rules. It is also important to note that the genomic sequencing data we gather from you is inherently identifiable if it is linked back to your other personal information (e.g. name, address) because it contains your unique genetic make-up. In order to protect your genomic sequencing data, we will de-identify the information, meaning we will remove any identifiable information, such as name and date of birth, from the data set. However, because the data contains your unique genetic make-up, the data can act as an identifier if it were linked back to your name or other personal information. \n\nIf you decide to participate in this study, the research team at the Mount Sinai Hospital (study investigators, coordinators, nurses, and delegates) will collect personal information about you, including OHIP number, personal health information from your medical records and other sources of clinical data, as well as your contact information (name, address, phone number, email) for the purposes of re-contacting you, if you agree to it. This personal information will not be shared outside of the Sinai Health System research team.\n \nGeneral research results (such as number of participants in the study, diseases studied, age of the participants, etc.) and data that cannot be linked back to you will be available to other researchers in what we call an open access database, i.e. open to other members of the scientific and medical community and do not need any specific permission to access the data. Any genomic data shared in a controlled access databank will not contain any personal information such as your name, OHIP, DOB which can be used to identify you.\n\nIf you choose to receive the consent form and other study documents via email, please be aware that communication via e-mail is not absolutely secure. We do not recommend that you communicate sensitive personal information via e-mail.\n\nA copy of the consent form that you sign to enter the study may be included in your health record/hospital chart.&quot; ] ;

You can decline to take part in any future research when you are approached and are not obliged to participate if you have agreed to be re-contacted. If you agree now but change your mind later to be re-contacted you can remove yourself from this list at any time by contacting the principle investigator or the study coordinator. If you do not wish to be re-contacted you can still take part in this study. We will keep your re-contact information for up to 25 years, after which time we will no longer contact you without your permission.\nI understand that I may be contacted in the future to learn about genetic test results. On the condition that we are able to find a safe and effective way of returning information to you about your genetic test result, please indicate your willingness to be re-contacted regarding the return of this information to you below:&quot; ] ;
