Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/observation-codes,ValueSet/mimic-observation-type-vital,ValueSet/mimic-observation-type-ed"

The main purpose of the code set is to facilitate use of federalstandards for classifying data on race and ethnicity when these data are exchanged, stored, retrieved,or analyzed in electronic form. At the same time, the code set can be applied to paper-based recordsystems to the extent that these systems are used to collect, maintain, and report data on race andethnicity in accordance with current federal standards.
